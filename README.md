## Software development project 

Type 1 Diabetes SNP Portal is a website founded by a group of 4 Master's students from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in 2023 under the supervision of Proffesor Conrad Bessant and Dr Matteo Fumagalli. The website was developed in order to leverage upon and link all the genomic, functional, and clinical information available on Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) / genetic variants associated with T1D, however properly interpreting the mapping of the genetic basis of T1D can be difficult. The Type 1 Diabetes SNP Portal makes it easier for users to retrieve genomic information of variants along with population, functional and clinical information ultimately making it easier to interpret the mapping of the genetic basis of T1D.
