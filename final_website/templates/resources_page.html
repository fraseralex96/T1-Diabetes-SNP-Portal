				<h2>Additional Information </h2>
				<p>Here are some useful resources that were used to develop the website database. Information from these databases were used for data collection and for data analysis guidance. More details are provided below.</p>

				<h2 > GWAS Catalog</h2>
				<p> The GWAS Catalog provides a consistent, searchable, visualisable and freely available database of SNP-trait associations, which can be easily integrated with other resources, and is accessed by scientists, clinicians and other users worldwide. Within the Catalog, all eligible published GWA studies are identified by literature search and assessed by our curators, who then extract the reported trait, significant SNP-trait associations, and sample metadata.</p>

				<h2> The International Genome Sample Resource</h2>
				<p> IGSR was set up to ensure the future usability and accessibility of data from the 1000 Genomes Project and to extend the data set produced by the 1000 Genomes Project to include new data generated from the 1000 Genomes Project samples and new populations where sampling has been carried out in line with IGSR sampling principles.</p>

				<h2>Ensembl database</h2>
				<p>Ensembl is a genome browser for vertebrate genomes that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation. Ensembl annotate genes, computes multiple alignments, predicts regulatory function and collects disease data. Ensembl tools include BLAST, BLAT, BioMart and the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for all supported species.</p>

				<h2> dbSNP database</h2>
				<p>dbSNP contains human single nucleotide variations, microsatellites, and small-scale insertions and deletions along with publication, population frequency, molecular consequence, and genomic and RefSeq mapping information for both common variations and clinical mutations. dbSNP Reference SNP (rs or RefSNP) number is a locus accession for a variant type assigned by dbSNP. </p>

				<h2> The Gene Ontology Resource</h2>
				<p>The mission of the GO Consortium is to develop an up-to-date, comprehensive, computational model of biological systems, from the molecular level to larger pathways, cellular and organism-level systems.The Gene Ontology knowledgebase provides a computational representation of our current scientific knowledge about the functions of genes from many different organisms, from humans to bacteria. It is widely used to support scientific research, and has been cited in tens of thousands of publications.</p>

				<h2>Polyphen-2</h2>
				<p> PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping v2) is a tool which predicts possible impact of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of a human protein using straightforward physical and comparative considerations. PolyPhen-2 is a new development of the PolyPhen tool for annotating coding nonsynonymous SNPs.</p>

				<h2>Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT)</h2>
				<p> SIFT predicts whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function based on sequence homology and the physical properties of amino acids. SIFT can be applied to naturally occurring nonsynonymous polymorphisms and laboratory-induced missense mutations.</p>
