7355	ZPBP2	biological_process	negative regulation of immunoglobulin production	Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate, or extent of immunoglobulin production.	GO:0002638
7356	ZPBP2	cellular_component	extracellular region	The space external to the outermost structure of a cell. For cells without external protective or external encapsulating structures this refers to space outside of the plasma membrane. This term covers the host cell environment outside an intracellular parasite.	GO:0005576
7357	ZPBP2	cellular_component	nucleus	A membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells in which chromosomes are housed and replicated. In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent.	GO:0005634
7358	ZPBP2	biological_process	sphingolipid metabolic process	The chemical reactions and pathways involving sphingolipids, any of a class of lipids containing the long-chain amine diol sphingosine or a closely related base (a sphingoid).	GO:0006665
7359	ZPBP2	biological_process	binding of sperm to zona pellucida	The process in which the sperm binds to the zona pellucida glycoprotein layer of the egg. The process begins with the attachment of the sperm plasma membrane to the zona pellucida and includes attachment of the acrosome inner membrane to the zona pellucida after the acrosomal reaction takes place.	GO:0007339
7360	ZPBP2	cellular_component	cytoplasmic vesicle	A vesicle found in the cytoplasm of a cell.	GO:0031410
7361	ZPBP2	biological_process	circadian regulation of gene expression	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression such that an expression pattern recurs with a regularity of approximately 24 hours.	GO:0032922
7362	ZPBP2	cellular_component	cell body	The portion of a cell bearing surface projections such as axons, dendrites, cilia, or flagella that includes the nucleus, but excludes all cell projections.	GO:0044297
7363	ZPBP2	biological_process	membrane lipid catabolic process	The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the breakdown of membrane lipids, any lipid found in or associated with a biological membrane.	GO:0046466
